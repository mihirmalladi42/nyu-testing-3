            <m>{\LARGE \textbf {1 Hello World!}}</m>
            <p></p>

                <m>{\textbf{Hello World! }} </m> Today I am learningliaeoufhgurhdjilkmvaeiopkljdfnikl <m> \LaTeX. </m> <m> \LaTeX </m> is a great program for writing math. I can write in line match such as <m> a^2 + b^2 = c^2. </m> I can also give equations their own space:
                <me>
                    \gamma^2 + \theta^2 = \omega^2
                </me>
                If I do not leave any blank lines <m> \LaTeX </m> will continue this text wihtout making it into a new paragraph. Notice how there was no indentation in the text after equation.
                    Also notice how even though I hit enter after that sentence and here <m>\downarrow</m>
                <m>\LaTeX</m> formats the sentence without any break. Also look how it doesn't matter how many spaces i put between my words.
            </p>
            <p>
                For a new paragraph I can leave a blank space in my code.
