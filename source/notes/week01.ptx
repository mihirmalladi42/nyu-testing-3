         <m>{\textbf{Hello World! }}</m> Today I am learning <m>\LaTeX. </m> <m>\LaTeX{} </m> is a great program for writing math. I can write in line math such as <m>a^2+b^2=c^2</m>. I can also give equations their own space.
         <me>x^2 + y^2 = z^2</me> 
           If I do not leave any blank lines <m>\LaTeX{}</m> will continue  this text without making it into a new paragraph.  Notice how there was no indentation in the text after equation.  
               Also notice how even though I hit enter after that sentence and here <m>\downarrow</m>
     <m>\LaTeX{}</m> formats the sentence without any break.  Also   look  how      it   doesn't     matter          how    many  spaces     I put     between       my    words.
        </p><p>
    For a new paragraph I can leave a blank space in my code.
